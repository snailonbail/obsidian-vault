Special dice have an outline around them with the same color as the normal dice, so that it doesn't look too jarring.

Special dice should also popup like the normal dice does

On a critical failure: 
The turn is skipped shortly after rolling the dice
This character also takes 20% more damage this turn
Add the status effect "distracted"
Add a bunch of random messages to be distracted to
Distracted runs out at the start on the next turn of this character


On a critical success:
It's added a new move to the top of the novelist
This is the characters "power move", a move that costs 20 energy
The move has a flashy background to make it distinct from the others
Upon using the power move, a cut-in animation appears and performs the move
After the power move is used, the character turns ends
A cut-in doesn't happen if the player doesn't select the power move
