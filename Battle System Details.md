The battle system will be one of the main [[Game Mechanics]] of the [[Tempus Fangame]].

Both parties can have up to 4 [[Battle Characters]] in battle, that will act based on the turn order.

A character turn happens as follows:

1. The camera focus on the back of the character;
    If needed, the combat layout will change so that the current active team is on the bottom facing up, and the opposing team is facing down.
2. The character will roll a D20, and the resulting value will be its energy during this turn;
3. If the character is a playable character, a layout will show the [[Available Combat Action]] that character can take with the available energy;
4. After choosing an action, it will execute it and proceed to end the characters turn, starting the turn of the next character in the turn order;

This cycle will continue until all characters on one team are downed.
If the player team wins, they'll return to the overworld and gain some rewards for the battle.

If the enemy team wins, a gameover panel will show up, where the player will need to reload a previous save or return to the titlescreen.
