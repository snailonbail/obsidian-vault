This is the transcript of what happened in the first session of the Tempus DnD series, to be used on the first chapter of [[Tempus Fangame]].

# Backstory

	This party of three adventurers took a quest by a local noblewoman who had two children, a son and a daughter, and they became adventurers against her will, joined a party of four, and went exploring in a nearby ruins, called the Sunless Citadel. They never returned.

	That was about a month and a half ago, about five to six weeks ago.
	She requested a party of hearty adventurers to arrive at Oakhurst, which is the town she rules over.

	They came, they negotiated a handsome reward to recover her children alive if possible, their bodies if not, and if there was nothing else left of them, just a signet ring that each of them had on their fingers, that signified that they were a part of that noble house.	
	In addition to that, because she has dominion over this entire area, they have full salvage rights over whatever they find in the Sunless Citadel. They can keep whatever they want, even if they should fail their quest and not be able to recover any of the children or find out what happened to them, they can still take what they find and then leave.

	They took the quest, they headed out over to the ravine, the Sunless Citadel is at the bottom of a very deep ravine near Oakhurst.
	They found a rope that was attached to a stone pillar near the ravine and they descended into the ravine. They landed on a sandy outcrop, a ledge, where they were ambushed by giant rats.

	After a fierce battle, Catxel XIII, which was formely known and Catxel XII, went down, but CurioBOT, the killbot of the century, managed to protect Catxel XIII, protecting him from taking fatal damage, dispatch the rats in easy order, with the help of Altor, and they were able to recover, take a short rest, regain their stamina and their health, and now they're ready to continue further down into the ravine to the Sunless Citadel.

# First act

**CurioBOT**: 
	"I will not lie, those three rats almost killed all of us..."
	"...and to my knowledge, what lies further into this dungeon is much much worse."

**Altor**:
	"Those were some big rats, so I'm not surprised."

**Catxel**:
	"I mean, they literally fucking, like, killed me, so..."

**CurioBOT**: 
	"Catxel almost died."

**Catxel**:
	"Yeah, nearly, if you guys didn't save me!"
	"If it weren't for you guys, I would have died there, so thanks, y'know."

**Altor**:
	"Hey Catxel, how much health do you got?"

**Catxel**:
	"Me? I got 19 health right now."
	"I'm a tanky guy, what are you gonna say, you know."

**Altor**:
	"Alright, I was just wondering if you needed some healing."

**CurioBOT**: 
	"I think our only option is to venture further down."

**Altor**:
	"Yeah, we gotta find those kids."
	"We gotta go!"

**Catxel**:
	"Yeah, that's true."

**CurioBOT**: 
	"And most importantly, the loot that lies deep down."

**Catxel**:
	"Yeah, the treasure, y'know!"

**Altor**:
	"Hm..."
	"You're only here for the treasure, aren't you!"

**Catxel**:
	"Nononononono!"
	"Of course, saving people is, y'know, priority!"
	"Obviously, haha. What are you talking about?"


CurioBOT has notices a fireplace ring. Among the rubble is an old ring of stones that contains the accumulated ash of hundreds of campfires, though no fire has been lit here for a few years, clearly, just by observing it. Inside the ash pile are a few rough hewn spear tips of goblin manufacturer, and small animal bones. 


**Altor**:
	"It's okay boys, we can become the goblin slayer!"

**CurioBOT**: 
	"It seems many has passed here before us...."

**Altor**:
	"It's only one way down, you guys ready?"

**Catxel**:
	"Well, let's go down then!"


Altor peeks over the edge of the ravine. It's just pitch black on the other side of the ravine.

**CurioBOT**: 
	"Catxel, what does you cat-like vision shows us?"

Catxel peers into the darkness, with his dark vision. 
From it, a fortress emerges from the darkness. 
A subterranean Citadel, though impressive, seems long forgotten, as if the lightless windows, cracked crellinations and leaning towers are any indication.
All is quiet, though a cold breeze blows up from below, bringing with it the scent of dust, and a faint trace of rot.
Since you descended into the ravine, the temperature has plummeted at least 20 degrees already, from up above.

**Altor**:
	"Oh, my cold-blooded bones are getting a little chilly..."

**Catxel**:
	"Oh shit, it's kinda cold down here man!"

**CurioBOT**: 
	"You fleshbags, I remain unaffected by temperature!"

**Altor**:
	"Hey!"
	"Think about the others a little bit, won't ya?"

**CurioBOT**: 
	"So what do you see?"

**Catxel**:
	"I see a city. Like, a town."
	"Some underground city... What do you call it? Like..."

**CurioBOT**: 
	"Does it appear occupied?"

**Catxel**:
	"I don't know...."
	"...probably now from the looks of it."

**Altor**:
	"We gotta keep our wits about us, there's like lots of goblins around here."

**Catxel**:
	"Yeah, it might be a goblins, y'know, city."
	"They might be residing in it."
	"I-I don't know man, looks kinda..."
	"... kinda dangerous, I would be on alert."
	"Anyways, CurioBOT, we're kinda cold here, don't you have like a flamethrower on your arm or something?"

**CurioBOT**: 
	"..."
	"Alright. I urge you to step back very slightly."

**Catxel**:
	"O-Okay..."

**CurioBOT**: 
	"You do not wish to be singed by my fiery breath!"

**Catxel**:
	"Okay, shit."
	"G-Go on..."

**CurioBOT**: 
	"Alright!"
	"I am equiped with many accoutrements!"
	"Allow me to take this moment to describe to you what lies within CurioBOT's body."
	"In my left arm, it splits down the middle, flipping on either side."
	"From the middle of my forearm extends a rod and at the end of the rod a sphere pops out, and from this sphere, spikes on this ball".
	"It's a mace! I'm equiped with a mace! And at the end of the mace it spins."
	"I have a mace arm!".

**Altor**:
	"Hey catxel, I don't think this guy is human."

**Catxel**:
	"Y-You just noticed?!"

**CurioBOT**: 
	"Silence! I'm demostrating!"
	"On my other arm, similarly, splits down the middle, opening. 
	And from it, a slightly larger rod extends. Tubes attached, following down my arm until the end, and from it, I can spout fire. 
	Stand back as I demonstrate!"

 **Altor**:
	"Oh! Warmth, finally!"
	"I'mma step a little closer."

**CurioBOT**: 
	"Be careful, the flames are on wildly"

 **Altor**:
	"It's okay, I got a big shield!"

**Catxel**:
	"I have a fucking dagger, dude... That's all I have, man."
	"You got all these like... fire, mace, lik-"

**CurioBOT**: 
	"The flames!"
	"The flames, they originate from my patron."
	"My other wordly patron, the Fiend. A spirit of Hellfire!"
	"Anyways..."
	"...I'm equipped with one last method of eliminating my foes."
	"I would not demonstrate it here, least you be vaporized."
	"From my chest, my chassis."
	"It can open up and from it, what appears to be a railgun of some sort."
	"My Eldritch Blast! Where the screams of a thousand banshees, vaporizing all of those who oppose me. 
	"And, as noted earlier, my foes. Those who be stricken down by CurioBOT, as their souls leave their bodies, in an effort to enter the land above..."
	"CurioBOT is able to pull their essence, and from their souls, a red shield is formed."
	"You can hear the faint screams of their soul attempting to escape, but CurioBOT as captured their essence."

**Catxel**:
	"..."
	"T-That's creepy, y'all!"

 **Altor**: 
	"You kinda scary dude, aren't you."
	"I always knew you were kind of a creepy guy, but..."

**CurioBOT**: 
	"Let us continue!"

**Catxel**:
	"Ayo CurioBOT, you know like..."
	"...if you robots take over the world someday, let me just let you know that..."
	"... I fucking love robots! So, y'know..."

**CurioBOT**: 
	"I am no robot. I am a warforged."

**Catxel**:
	"M-My bad. I love warforgeds!"
	"They're like the sickest"
