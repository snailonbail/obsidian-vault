These will be the main game mechanics and gameplay loops of the [[Tempus Fangame]].

It will feature an 3D overworld where the player moves a team of characters around, and face enemies in battle to level up and complete a main objective.

The player will be able to change which character he controls. Each character has a special interaction with the overworld, which can be used to progress the plot of the game.

Battles will occur when the team come in contact with an enemy in the overworld. It'll feature some dice mechanics to mimic and reference DnD.
