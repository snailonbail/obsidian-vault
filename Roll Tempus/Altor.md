Thank you for such an amazing year with all the incredible support ! !

  
While 2021 was the year of me going "I'll give this one last chance and if I can't do it I give up for good", 2022 was the "OK damn, but can you keep it up tho?!"


It was the most gamedev work I got the chance to work on in any given year! Thank you for sticking with me~

2023 will be insane I promise, starting with these two.
