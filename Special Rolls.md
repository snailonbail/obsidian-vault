Special rolls happen when a character rolls a specific number at the start of their turn.

* **Rolling 1**: Called a critical failure;
   The character will be unable to use any moves or items during this turn, instead skipping its turn and receiving a debuff to defense during that turn, after a simple animation of the character tripping plays out.

* **Rolling 20**: Called a critical success;
  The character will have a special move show up at the top of the moves list that wasn't previously there. The move varies from character to character, but in general should be the most powerful move that character can do.
